    "## About Python :\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The history of Python starts with ABC. ABC is a general-purpose programming language and programming environment\n",
    "Python was conceptualized in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum while working on ABC\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why name Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Creator was a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is a high level programming language like C++, PHP, and Java. \n",
    "* There are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. a\n",
    "* Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low-level language. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages.\n",
    "* But the advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. \n",
    "* Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another\n"

    "## Interpreter VS Compiler\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations\n",
    "* A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the source code, and the translated program is called the object code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation.\n",
    "* Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a lower level language, called bytecode, and then interpreted by a program called a virtual machine. Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.\n"

    "* Python is object-oriented - Structure supports such concepts as polymorphism, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance\n",
    "* It's free (open source) - Downloading and installing Python is free and easy. Source code is easily accessible. Free doesn't mean unsupported!  Online Python community is huge\n",
    "* It's portable - Python runs virtually every major platform used today. As long as you have a compatible Python interpreter installed, Python programs will run in exactly the same manner, irrespective of platform\n",
    "* It's powerful - Dynamic typing. Built-in types and tools. Library utilities. Third party utilities (e.g. Numeric, NumPy, SciPy). Automatic memory management.\n",
    "* It's mixable - Python can be linked to components written in other languages easily\n",
    "* Linking to fast, compiled code is useful to computationally intensive problems\n",
    "* Python is good for code steering and for merging multiple programs in otherwise conflicting languages\n",
    "* Python/C integration is quite common\n",
    "* It's easy to use - Rapid turnaround: no intermediate compile and link steps as in C or C++. Python programs are compiled automatically to an intermediate form called bytecode, which the interpreter then reads. This gives Python the development speed of an interpreter without the performance loss inherent   in purely interpreted languages\n",
